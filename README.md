# Digital-Storage-Converter
A program that asks the user to input an amount of physical storage then convert the supplied number of all units of digital storage.


Project Requirements:

Write a program that demonstrates how real-world terms describing storage are represented in the computer. Allow the user to supply a number and unit representing some amount of physical storage (e.g., "500 GB"). Convert the supplied number to all of the following units:

Bits (b)
Bytes (B)
Kilobytes (KB)
Megabytes (MB)
Gigabytes (GB)
Kilobits (Kb)
Megabits (Mb)
Gigabits (Gb)

Additionally, indicate to the user how many bits are needed to address the amount of storage you have entered (for example, 10GB of RAM cannot be addressed in a single 32-bit address).

Your program must be able to detect the units supplied by the user by parsing the input string.

Your program may be written in any language. Your program should use an appropriate data type that has the ability to store large numbers (for the bits calculation), but you do not need to accept an input more than 1152921504 GB for the purposes of this assignment.
